# Umbral Box Base Operating system

Customized Underlying Raspbian Operating System for the Umbral box (based on https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen)

## Config/Build instructions

To come soon

## TODO:

- Get source for building the base OS in here. (Use work created in [here](https://github.com/lncm/pi-gen/tree/lncmbox))
- Customize source for Umbral box
- Set up automated build on release because building this each time is extremely painful.
